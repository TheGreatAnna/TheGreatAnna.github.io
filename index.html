         I studied at UC Berkeley in 2025 Spring via the Berkeley Global Access Visiting Student Program. Out of my interest in combinatorics,<br>
         I enrolled in <a href="https://www.ucw.cz/~kral/math272.html">MATH272</a>, a graduate course instructed by professor Daniel Kr&aacute;l, topics include permutons, Szemerediâ€™s regularity lemma,<br>
         homomorphism density and graphons, entropy method in proving the Sidorenko property, and Benjamini-Schramm convergence of sparse graphs are covered.

         I joined the <a href="https://www.chuanhao-li.com/images/HYP.pdf">Honors Youth Program</a> of Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2020, right after my graduation from my junior high school.<br>
         In this program, I met young students from all over the country. We participated in mathematical modeling competitions,<br>
         wrote poems, rehearsed plays, participated in sports games, and forged deep friendships in the process.

  My research interests include extremal combinatorics and graph theory. To be specific, I am 
  interested in the following topics<br>
  (i) Ramsey theory<br>
  (ii) Graph coloring problems<br>
  (iii) Tur&aacute;n type problems
  </p>
  <p>
  Due to my research training experience, I am also interested in the interdisciplinary topics in combinatorics and optimization i.e., combinatorial optimization.
  One may refer to <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/learn-43/lib/photoz/.g/web/glossary/comb.html#:~:text=Combinatorial%20optimization%20is%20the%20process,N%2Ddimensional%20continuous%20space).">this page</a> for more information of this field. Interestingly, some graph coloring problems 
  like the classical four color problem can also be viewed as combinatorial optimization problems.

    The work in the following paper was mainly completed in <a href="http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gaoyibo/reu.html">PACE 2024</a>, an REU project focusing on algebraic combinatorics, and was held by the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research and Peking University. 
    This is joint work with Luan Chen and our mentor is <a href="https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jgml/sxgcx/wgl/index.htm">David Guoliang Wang</a>. <a href="PACE-Chromatic symmetric function group.html">Here</a> is a photo of our group (from left to right: Luan Chen, me, David Guoliang Wang).

    The following work was mainly completed during my exchange study at UC Berkeley. For this work, I would like to thank Dr. Pengcheng Xie, who kindly offered me the opportunity to collaborate, provided important advice and precious ideas during our collaboration. The paper has been submitted to the Mathematics of 
    Operations Research, and is currently under review.
